# benchmarks

The benchmarks live in this folder:

In order to measure the list on crawl the `urls-input.txt` file is required in this folder.

## Considerations

Rate limiting is set on most of the domains on the list. Connection errors will arise
more often the more the runs perform.

## Running

`cargo bench`
